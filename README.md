# Arduino Library for BaseJumper Base Boards

BaseJumper base boards come equipped with a range of interfaces such as analog inputs & outputs, digital inputs & outputs,
motor drivers, high-side switches, encoder interfaces, RS485 and CAN bus (to name a few). All circuits are highly rugged 
and well suited for applications in industrial control, mobile equipment and agriculture. This library allows you to 
access all the base board features from a sketch running on your Arduino.
